# CO_GP_Assembler-Simulator
CO_GP_Assembler-Simulator is a Python-based program that serves as an assembler and simulator for a simple CO_GP (Custom One-Gate Processor) architecture. It takes CO_GP assembly code as input, assembles it into machine code, and simulates the execution of the machine code on the CO_GP architecture.

Features
Assembler: Converts CO_GP assembly code into machine code.
Simulator: Executes the machine code on the CO_GP architecture and displays the output.
Supports a simple CO_GP instruction set architecture.

Requirements
Python 3.x
